# tabGrouper
It's designed to be minimal, yet effective.  The extension alphabetizes tabs by hostname - effectively grouping tabs with shared hosts, which solves an organizational (or OCD) problem in my life.

## tabGrouper has 3 triggers
1. When the extension's button is clicked
2. When the shortkey (defaulted to CTRL + SHIFT + Y / CMD + SHIFT + Y) listed in ```manifest.json``` is pressed
3. When a new tab is opened
